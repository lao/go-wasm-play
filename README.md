# Playing with Go and WebAssembly

repo for this [tutorial](https://golangbot.com/webassembly-using-go/), just to play around with Go building to Wasm

## Scripts

```bash
# build the wasm package with go
make build.wasm 
# build the wasm package with tiny-go
make build.wasm.tinygo 
# run the server 
make run.server
```

## Tiny-go problems

> **syscall/js.finalizeRef not implemented**

# TODO:
- [x] basic go package built to webassembly and called from js
- [x] reduce size of bin generated by go (maybe follow [this](https://dev.bitolog.com/minimizing-go-webassembly-binary-size/))

- [ ] load files from html input tag and checksum with go
- [ ] compress files with different algorithms from go and benchmark
- [ ] resize and other image related actions and benchmark
- [ ] test with big files
- [ ] try to add async func https://issuecloser.com/blog/golang-wasm-async-function
