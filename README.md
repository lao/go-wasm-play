# Playing with Go and WebAssembly

repo for this [tutorial](https://golangbot.com/webassembly-using-go/), just to play around with Go building to Wasm

## Scripts

```bash
make build-wasm 
make run-server
```

# TODO:
- [x] basic go package built to webassembly and called from js
- [ ] load files from html input tag and checksum with go

- [ ] compress files with different algorithms from go and benchmark
- [ ] resize and other image related actions and benchmark
- [ ] test with big files
- [ ] reduce size of bin generated by go (maybe follow [this](https://dev.bitolog.com/minimizing-go-webassembly-binary-size/))
